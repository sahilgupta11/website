        <h1>History Of Watches</h1>
        <p class="history">A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to
            keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed
            to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands,
            leather straps or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket,
            often attached to a chain.

            Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th
            century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by
            winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called mechanical
            watches.[1][2] In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and
            kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market
            from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis
            in Switzerland).[3][4] Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like
            electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but
            these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.

            In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. For mechanical watches, various
            extra features called "complications," such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon,
            are sometimes included.[5] Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features
            such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions. Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even
            incorporate calculators, GPS[6] and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and
            some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.
            Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. However, expensive collectible
            watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for
            simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more
            expensive than electronic ones.[3][4][7] As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the
            Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989,
            fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014.[8][9][10][11][12] As of December
            2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster
            Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.</p>
